This project focuses on the **analysis and interactive exploration of large-scale aviation data** using **Big Data technologies**. The objective is to extract meaningful insights from millions of flight records by leveraging distributed data processing and real-time visualization techniques.

The system analyzes domestic US flights data from the **Reporting Carrier On-Time Performance** dataset, restricted to the year **2013**, comprising over **6 million records** with detailed information on schedules, delays, cancellations, and diversions. The backend is powered by **Apache Spark (PySpark)**, while the frontend is implemented using **Streamlit** to provide an interactive, user-friendly analytical dashboard.

This project was developed as part of the coursework exam for the *Models and Techniques for Big Data* course during the academic year **2022/2023**.
